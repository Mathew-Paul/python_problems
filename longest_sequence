The school principal gathered students from different classes.
They had to say their roll numbers and line up in order from smallest to largest. 
They were to count consecutive subsequences in this line. 
The main goal was to identify the longest consecutive sequence of 'n'initial roll numbers. This activity was to make school fun and help students practice math and organization.
Your task is to write an algorithmic code to find the longest consecutive sequence.

Definition of consecutive sequence: Numbers that follow each other continuously in the order from smallest to largest are called consecutive numbers.
Constraints :0 <= nums.length <= 10^5-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Inputs :6 = number of elements
[100,4,200,1,3,2] = elements

Output:4
Explanation:In ascending order: 1,2,3,4,100,200
Maximum consecutive sequence : 1,2,3,4 = 4



class Solution:
    def longest_seq(self,nums):
        num_set = set(nums)
        max_length = 0
        for n in num_set:
            if n - 1 not in num_set:
                current_num = n
                current_length = 1
            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        return max_length
elements = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

s=Solution()
print(s.longest_seq(elements))
