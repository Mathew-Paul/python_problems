Find the pyramid sum of the given list. A pyramid sum is calculated by repeated addition of consecutive numbers until the list has one element.
eg: Input
[1,2,3]
Output:
8

Explanation. list is reduced as [1+2,2+3] = [3,5] which is reduced to [3+5]. So the output is 8

Solution:
----------------

def pyramid_sum(lst):
    while len(lst) > 1:
        new_lst = []
        for i in range (len(lst)-1):
            new_lst.append(lst[i] + lst[i+1])
        lst = new_lst
    return lst[0]

a=[1,2,3]
pyramid_result = pyramid_sum(a)
print(pyramid_result)
