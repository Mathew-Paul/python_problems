PROBLEM:
Ram, who have scares to stars, found himself constantly bothered by his friend's liking for them.
One day, his friend presented him with a game designed to help overcome his fear. In this game, Ram is presented with a string containing a mix of characters and stars. 
His objective isto select a star and eliminate both the star itself and the nearest non-star character to its left.
This process continues until there are no stars left in the string. Once all stars are removed,Ram must return the remaining string.
Can you help Ram by writing an algorithmic code ?
  
Constraints :
● 1<= s.length <=10^5
● S consists of lowercase english letters and star 
  
*Input 0 :"leet**cod*e"
Output 0 :"Lecoe"
Input 1 :"erase*****"
Output 1 :""

Solution:
class Solution:
    def star_del(self,s):
        st=[]
        for c in s:
            if(c=="*"):
                if st:
                    st.pop()
            else:
                st.append(c)
        return "".join(st)
s=Solution()
print(s.star_del("erase****"))
